# R-Nova

R-Nova provides interoperability between Nova and R. For this initial release, this includes

- syntax definitions for R and R Markdown, to allow highlighting of these files in Nova; and
- an interface to the [`languageserver` R package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=languageserver) to provide linting and completions for R code.

Further functionality will be added in future.
